# Final-project-SDA

The project involves creating, executing, and validating test scenarios for various tasks related to database tables and API methods. Here's a breakdown:

## 1. Verify Database Table
### Requirements for Writing Test Scenarios
- Understand the structure of the database table, the expected data it should contain, and the operations it should support.

### Proposed Test Scenarios
- Check table creation, verify data insertion, update, deletion, and retrieval operations, and ensure data integrity and constraints.

### Testing the Task
- Execute the test cases and verify that the database table performs as expected.

## 2. GET Method
### Requirements for Writing Test Scenarios
- Understand the endpoint, the expected response structure, and any parameters it accepts.

### Proposed Test Scenarios
- Test the method with valid and invalid inputs, verify response codes, data consistency, and error handling.

### Testing the Task
- Execute the test cases and validate that the GET method retrieves data as expected.

## 3. DELETE Method
### Requirements for Writing Test Scenarios
- Understand the endpoint, the expected behavior upon deletion, and any constraints.

### Proposed Test Scenarios
- Test the method with valid and invalid inputs, verify response codes, successful deletion, and data integrity.

### Testing the Task
- Execute the test cases and validate that the DELETE method performs as expected.

## 4. POST Method
### Requirements for Writing Test Scenarios
- Understand the endpoint, the expected request and response structures, and data validation rules.

### Proposed Test Scenarios
- Test the method with valid and invalid inputs, verify response codes, data creation, and error handling.

### Testing the Task
- Execute the test cases and validate that the POST method creates data as expected.

## 5. Retesting and Regression Testing
### GET Method
- Re-test and perform regression testing to ensure that the GET method continues to work after changes.

### DELETE Method
- Re-test and perform regression testing to ensure that the DELETE method continues to work after changes.
